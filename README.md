# Euromillions Key Generator
A really simple extension that uses euromillions statistics to
generate a random key. All methods used here are really dumb and silly,
I'm just a lazy person who wanted a random key generator with slitly more **imaginary** odds =D

Only works in this [link](https://www.jogossantacasa.pt/web/SCEstatisticas/) for now...

## **DISCLAIMER**
**Be aware of the odds of the euromillions game before you play it!**
**This is just a project made for fun with the only goal of not have to thinking on a key for euromillions!**
**This does not increase your odds of winning euromillions!**
**This will not make make you win more at euromillions!**
**This can not and/or should not be used as an incentive to make you play more at euromillions!**
**This can not be accountable for any amount of money that the user might loose by playing on euromillions!**

## TODO:
  [x] Create sily logic for better imaginary odds
  [x] Create an first iteration raw extension
  [ ] Figure out a way to have the code splitted in different files and better file structure (modular type)
      [ ] Consider using [link](https://github.com/narralabs/brackets) to allow
  [ ] Improve the UI
  [ ] Use real statistics methods / models
  [ ] Use other source for statistics data so it doesn't require to be in any specific page
  [ ] (Maybe?) Generate more than one key
  [ ] ...

### Feel free to anything!
Feel free to use it,
Feel free to drop sugestions to improve it,
Feel free to colaborate with me on it,
Or just feel free to just roast the code or any of the sily logic. =D
